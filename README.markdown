WordPress Plugin Directory Slurper
==================================

A command line PHP script that downloads and updates a copy of the latest stable
version of every plugin in the [WordPress.org plugin repository][repo].

Really handy for doing local searches across all WordPress plugins.

[repo]: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/

Requirements
------------

* PHP 5.2
* wget
* Unix system (only tested on Mac OS X)

Instructions
------------

1. `cd WordPress-Plugin-Directory-Slurper`
2. `./update`

The `plugins/` directory will contain all the plugins, when the script is done.

FAQ
----

### Why download the zip files? Why not use SVN? ###

An SVN checkout of the entire repository is a BEAST of a thing. You don't want it, 
trust me. Updates and cleanups can take **hours** or even **days** to complete.

### Why not just do an SVN export of each plugin's trunk? ###

There is no guarantee that the plugin's trunk is the latest stable version. The 
repository supports doing development in trunk, and designating a branch or tag 
as the stable version. Using the zip file gets around this, as it figures it all 
out and gives you the latest stable version

### How long will it take? ###

Your first update will take a while. You'd be well-advised to let it run overnight. 
But subsequent updates are smart. The script tracks the SVN revision number of your
latest update and then asks the Plugins Trac install for a list of plugins that have 
changed since. Only those changed plugins are updated after the initial sync.

### How much disk space do I need? ###

As of December 09, 2015, it takes up about `22GB`, at revision `1303145`.

### Something went wrong, how do I do a partial update? ###

The last successful update revision number is stored in `plugins/.last-revision`. 
You can just overwrite that and the next `update` will start after that revision.
